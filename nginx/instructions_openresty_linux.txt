On Linux, have to install the pre-requisites pcre and libpq

To configure OpenResty, do:

./configure --with-cc-opt="-I/usr/local/include" --with-ld-opt="-L/usr/local/lib" --with-http_postgres_module --with-luajit

Some other options that you might want to include:

--with-pcre-jit --with-ipv6 --prefix=/your/preferred/path/to/openresty

Then do:

make
sudo make install
